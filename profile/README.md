Atlas Research unifies your entire research workflow in one intelligent workspace. Write code in integrated Jupyter notebooks, analyze papers with AI-powered PDF processing, take notes with markdown editing, and link everything together in a knowledge graph as your second brain.

Inspired by Donald Knuth's vision of [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)—combining documentation, code, and thought process in one place.

## AI Agents

### 🧪 Notebook Editing Agent
Generate complete Jupyter notebooks from natural language. Debug code, add visualizations, and build analysis pipelines with AI assistance.

### 📄 Paper Analysis Agent
Extract insights from research papers, convert equations to executable code, and reproduce paper results automatically.

### ✍️ Markdown Editing Agent
Create structured research notes, organize findings, and format documentation with intelligent assistance.

## Linking: Your Research Knowledge Graph

Connect code cells to related notes, link papers to implementations, and trace ideas from discovery to execution. Build a searchable knowledge graph of your work that grows with you.
